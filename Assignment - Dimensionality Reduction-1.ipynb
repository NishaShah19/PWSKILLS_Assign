    "#### Q1. What is the curse of dimensionality reduction and why is it important in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Curse of Dimensionality refers to a set of problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data. The dimension of a dataset corresponds to the number of attributes/features that exist in a dataset. A dataset with a large number of attributes, generally of the order of a hundred or more, is referred to as high dimensional data. Some of the difficulties that come with high dimensional data manifest during analyzing or visualizing the data to identify patterns, and some manifest while training machine learning models. The difficulties related to training machine learning models due to high dimensional data is referred to as ‘Curse of Dimensionality’. The popular aspects of the curse of dimensionality; ‘data sparsity’ and ‘distance concentration’ are discussed in the following sections.\n",

    "#### Q2. How does the curse of dimensionality impact the performance of machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the number of dimensions or features increases, the amount of data needed to generalize the machine learning model accurately increases exponentially. The increase in dimensions makes the data sparse, and it increases the difficulty of generalizing the model"

    "\n",
    "- Feature selection is the process of selecting the subset of the relevant features and leaving out the irrelevant features present in a dataset to build a model of high accuracy. In other words, it is a way of selecting the optimal features from the input dataset.\n",
    "- The process of picking a subset of the features (also known as predictors or independent variables) in a dataset for use in a machine learning model is known as feature selection. The purpose of feature selection is to discover the features that are most relevant and significant for predicting the target variable (also known as the response or dependent variable)."

    "- In such situations, you can set a threshold value and use the missing values ratio method. The higher the threshold value, the more aggressive will be the dimensionality reduction. If the percentage of missing values in a variable exceeds the threshold, you can drop the variable."
