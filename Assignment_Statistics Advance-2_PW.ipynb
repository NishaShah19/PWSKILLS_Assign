    "\n",
    "The cumulative distribution function is used to describe the probability distribution of random variables. It can be used to describe the probability for a discrete, continuous or mixed variable. It is obtained by summing up the probability density function and getting the cumulative probability for a random variable. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable is another method to describe the distribution of random variables. The advantage of the CDF is that it can be defined for any kind of random variable (discrete, continuous, and mixed). It helps to calculate the probability of a random variable where the population is taken less than or equal to a particular value."

    "- The normal distribution is important because it can be used to approximate other types of probability distribution, such as binomial, hypergeometric, inverse (or negative) hypergeometric, negative binomial and Poisson distribution.\n",
    "- It has one of the important properties called central theorem. Central theorem means relationship between shape of population distribution and shape of sampling distribution of mean. This means that sampling distribution of mean approaches normal as sample size increase.\n",

Bernoulli is used when the outcome of an event is required for only one time, whereas the Binomial is used when the outcome of an event is required multiple times.\n",

    "A z-score measures the distance between a data point and the mean using standard deviations. Z-scores can be positive or negative. The sign tells you whether the observation is above or below the mean. For example, a z-score of +2 indicates that the data point falls two standard deviations above the mean, while a -2 signifies it is two standard deviations below the mean. A z-score of zero equals the mean.\n",
