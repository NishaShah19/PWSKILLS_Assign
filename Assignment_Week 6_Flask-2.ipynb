    "\n",
    "- POST: This method makes enables users to send data over to the server. e.g In any authentication-enabled application, the registration and login form is the best example for the post method. Whenever we enter Information and submit the data get transferred over to the POST request. And if we noticed, unlike get request there is no information will be ever displayed in the URL."

Flask uses the Jinja template library to render templates. In your application, you will use templates to render HTML which will display in the user's browser.\n",
