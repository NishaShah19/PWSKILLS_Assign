    "\n",
    "- Recall: The ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a data set. Mathematically, we define recall as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives. Precision: The ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points."

    "1. Binary is a classification of two groups, i.e. classifies objects in at most two classes. It is a process or task of classification, in which a given data is being classified into two classes.  Itâ€™s basically a kind of prediction about which of two groups the thing belongs to. "
