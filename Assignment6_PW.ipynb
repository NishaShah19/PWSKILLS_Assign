    "3. SQL databases are table based , NoSQL databases are document-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans – DDL known as Data definition Language , used to create and modify database objects such as tables, indices , users.\n",
    "Create – Used to create a new table in SQL.\n",
    "Example – create TABLE <Table_name>\n",
    "Create Table employee_info (emp_id , emp_name , emp_email_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP – Used to remove existing table along with its structure from database.\n",
    "Example – DROP TABLE <table_name>;\n",
    "DROP TABLE employee_info;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER – Used to add , delete or change columns in existing table.\n",
    "Example – ALTER TABLE <table_name>\n",
    "Add column_name datatype\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employee_info \n",
    "Add mobile_num;\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE – Used to remove all rows from the table without changing the structure of table.\n",
    "Example – TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employee_info;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "DML known as Data Manipulation Language, deals with manipulation of data present in the database.\n",
    "INSERT – Used to add new data to the database.\n",
    "Example - INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (column_name1 , column_name2 …)\n",
    "INSERT INTO employee_info( emp_id , emp_name , emp_email_id ) VALUES (001 , Mark , mark@gmail.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE – Allows users to update or modify the existing data in the database tables\n",
    "UPDATE TABLE_NAME SET (column_name1= value_1, ….., column_nameN = value_N) WHERE CONDITION;\n",
    "UPDATE employee_info emp_name = Elon WHERE emp_id = 001;\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE – Allows user to remove single or multiple existing records from the database tables.\n",
    "Example – DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "DELETE FROM emp_info where emp_id = 001;\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "Ans – DQL known as Data Query Language. Used for performing queries on the data , used to fetch data from the database.\n",
    "SELECT – Used to extract data from the database in order to perform any actions to it.\n",
    "Example – SELECT expressions FROM TABLES WHERE conditions;\n",
    "SELECT emp_name FROM emp_info where emp_id =001;\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "Ans – A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique.\n",
    "A foreign key is a column of data in a table that refers to unique data values.\n",
