    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multithreading (sometimes simply “threading”) is when a program creates multiple threads with execution cycling among them, so one longer-running task doesn't block all the others. This works well for tasks that can be broken down into smaller subtasks, which can then each be given to a thread to be completed.\n",
    "- Multithreading in Python is a popular technique that enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. In simple words, the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python multithreading facilitates sharing data space and resources of multiple threads with the main thread. It allows efficient and easy communication between the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to break down your tasks and applications into multiple sub-tasks and then execute them simultaneously, then multithreading in Python is your best bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "All important aspects such as performance, rendering, speed and time consumption will drastically be improved by using proper Python multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python should be used only when there is no existing inter-dependency between the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module\n",
    "The threading module is a high-level implementation of multithreading used to deploy an application in Python. To use multithreading, we need to import the threading module in Python Program. A start() method is used to initiate the activity of a thread."
