    "\n",
    "Estimation is a process in which we obtain the values of unknown population parameters with the help of sample data. In other words, it is a data analysis framework that combines effect sizes and confidence intervals to plan an experiment, analyze data, and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point Estimates\n",
    "A point estimate is a sample statistic calculated using the sample data to estimate the most likely value of the corresponding unknown population parameter. In other words, we derive the point estimate from a single value in the sample and use it to estimate the population value.\n",

    "- Selecting an appropriate statistical test: The choice of a statistical test depends \n",

    "available, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis, and \n",
    "regression analysis, among others.\n",
    "- Collecting and analyzing data: Data is collected from a sample, and the statistical \n",
    "test is applied to the sample data. The test generates a test statistic, which \n",
    "measures the degree of evidence against the null hypothesis. The test statistic \n",
    "follows a specific probability distribution under the assumption of the null \n",

    "smaller than the chosen significance level (α), the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",

It is used for estimating population parameters for small sample sizes or unknown variances. T-distributions have a greater chance for extreme values than normal distributions, and as a result have fatter tails.\n",
