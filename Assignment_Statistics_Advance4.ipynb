    "### Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - z-tests are used when we have large sample sizes (n > 30), whereas t-tests are most helpful with a smaller sample size (n < 30). Both methods assume a normal distribution of the data, but the z-tests are most useful when the standard deviation is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: The T-test is employed to compare means of small samples (usually when the sample size is less than 30), while the Z-test is used to compare means of large samples (typically when the sample size is equal to or greater than 30).\n",
    "- Assumptions: The T-test assumes the data to be approximately normally distributed, whereas the Z-test assumes both normally distributed data and a known population standard deviation.\n",
    "- Population Standard Deviation: The T-test deals with situations where the population standard deviation is unknown, while the Z-test assumes a known population standard deviation.\n",
    "- Sample Size: The T-test is suitable for analyzing small sample sizes (less than 30), whereas the Z-test is appropriate for large sample sizes (equal to or greater than 30).\n",
    "- Test Statistic: The T-test employs the T-distribution as the test statistic, while the Z-test utilizes the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution).\n",
    "- Degrees of Freedom: The T-test requires calculating the degrees of freedom using the formula n1 + n2 - 2, where n1 and n2 represent the sample sizes. The Z-test does not involve degrees of freedom.\n",
    "- Use Case: The T-test is commonly used for comparing means between groups, especially when working with small samples. The Z-test is employed for population mean comparisons, usually with large samples.\n",
    "- One-sample vs. Two-sample: Both the T-test and the Z-test can be applied in both one-sample and two-sample scenarios. However, the Z-test is more commonly used in two-sample situations.\n",
    "- Data Requirement: Both tests require raw data as input for analysis.\n",
    "- Complexity: The T-test is relatively more complex than the Z-test due to the calculation of degrees of freedom and the use of the T-distribution. The Z-test is comparatively simpler, making it easier to implement"

    "\n",
    "1. One tailed test - A one-tailed test is based on a uni-directional hypothesis where the area of rejection is on only one side of the sampling distribution. It determines whether a particular population parameter is larger or smaller than the predefined parameter. It uses one single critical value to test the data.A test of any statistical hypothesis, where the alternative hypothesis is one-tailed either right-tailed or left-tailed. For one-tailed, we use either > or < sign for the alternative hypothesis.When the alternative hypothesis specifies a direction then we use a one-tailed test.Critical region lies entirely on either the right side or left side of the sampling distribution. Here, the Entire level of significance (α) i.e. 5% has either in the left tail or right tail.It checks the relation between the variable in a singles direction.It checks the relation between the variable in a singles direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two Tailed test - A two-tailed test is also called a nondirectional hypothesis. For checking whether the sample is greater or less than a range of values, we use the two-tailed. It is used for null hypothesis testing.A test of a statistical hypothesis, where the alternative hypothesis is two-tailed.For two-tailed, we use ≠ sign for the alternative hypothesis.If no direction is given then we will use a two-tailed test.Critical region is given by the portion of the area lying in both the tails of the probability curve of the test statistic.It splits the level of significance (α) into half.Rejection region is from both sides i.e. left and right of the sampling distribution.It checks the relation between the variables in any direction.It is used to check whether the two mean different from one another or not."
