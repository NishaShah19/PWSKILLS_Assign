    "Ans- Ans- Missing data is defined as the values or data that is not stored (or not present) for some variable/s in the given dataset.It is important to handle missing values as they can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the data, which can significantly impact the accuracy of the analysis. There are several methods available to handle missing values, such as removal, imputation, flagging, etc.\n",
    "The k-NN algorithm can ignore a column from a distance measure when a value is missing. Naive Bayes can also support missing values when making a prediction. These algorithms can be used when the dataset contains null or missing values.\n"

    "Ans - Missing at Random (MAR) - Missing at Random means the data is missing relative to the observed data. It is not related to the specific missing values. The data is not missing across all observations but only within sub-samples of the data. It is not known if the data should be there; instead, it is missing given the observed data.. The missing data can be predicted based on the complete observed data. \n",

Data scientists can compare two sets of data, one with missing observations and one without. Using a t-test, if there is no difference between the two data sets, the data is characterized as MCAR.\n",
    "Data may be missing due to test design, failure in the observations or failure in recording observations. This type of data is seen as MCAR because the reasons for its absence are external and not related to the value of the observation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Missing Not at Random (MNAR) - The MNAR category applies when the missing data has a structure to it. In other words, there appear to be reasons the data is missing. In a survey, perhaps a specific group of people â€“ say women ages 45 to 55 â€“ did not answer a question. Like MAR, the data cannot be determined by the observed data, because the missing information is unknown. Data scientists must model the missing data to develop an unbiased estimate. Simply removing observations with missing data could result in a model with bias."

Data are regarded to be MAR when the probability that the responses are missing depends on the set of observed responses, but is not related to the specific missing values which is expected to be obtained.\n",
    "As we tend to consider randomness as not producing bias, we may think that MAR does not present a problem. However, MAR does not mean that the missing data can be ignored. If a dropout variable is MAR, we may expect that the probability of a dropout of the variable in each case is conditionally independent of the variable, which is obtained currently and expected to be obtained in the future, given the history of the obtained variable prior to that case."

    "\n",
    "Ans - A widely adopted and perhaps the most straightforward method for dealing with highly imbalanced datasets is called resampling. It consists of removing samples from the majority class (under-sampling) and/or adding more examples from the minority class (over-sampling)."

    "\n",
    "Ans - This technique is called oversampling. Similarly, we can randomly delete rows from the majority class to match them with the minority class which is called undersampling. After sampling the data we can get a balanced dataset for both majority and minority classes"
